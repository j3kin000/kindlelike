REACT NATIVE CODING EXAM

Programming Task - Kindle-like mobile app
 
Implement a simple application to render 2 files (book file) in an android and
iOS application on a tablet. The app must emulate the functionality where you
are reading a book file in your app like in a kindle app.
 
Please use the 2 sample text files provided to be rendered on your app. You
must be able to show and select which file to render on a book list then render
the book file selected. And no need to design or style the app, just show the
basic functionality of showing a list of books and rendering a book file into your
react-native app or emulating that &quot;reading a book&quot; functionality.
 
Send your repository link of your code so that we can review it and send a
video screen recording of running your app in Android and IOS tablet and to
show that it is working on your end.  You can use your built-in device emulator
to show your app in android and ios that it is working.
